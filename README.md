# NIR-VIS-RS-Registration-and-Dataset
-Infrared and visible remote sensing image registration algorithms and dataset containing sparse texture areas

-Our code is based on the LoFTR algorithm, and the configuration environment can refer to the following link:https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR/tree/master

-After configuring the environment, download the weight file from the following link and place it in * */RIZER/outdoor ds. The download link 
 is:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DOcOPZb3-5cWxLqn256AhwUVjBPifhuf?usp=sharing
